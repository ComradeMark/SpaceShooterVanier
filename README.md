# Vanier Space Shooter Project

This is the final programming (420-203) project for Vanier College by Mark Moutter, ID# 2354983

JavaFX version 20

## Building

- Build the project by downloading the complete repository ZIP file and opening it in an IDE of choice
- Ensure Gradle is supported and up-to-date
- Run project after setting proper Gradle build configuration

## Known bugs

Several bugs have been left in the final project implementation and would have been corrected had better time management been employed.
These bugs should be considered in grading and contribute to a lower mark.

1. Holding the space-bar during Game Over screen (activating Restart button) causes improper enemy spawning mechanics
2. Burst-fire (alternate fire mode) functionality was NOT implememented due to optimization issues with the feature (lowered frame rates)
